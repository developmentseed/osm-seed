# An Apache configuration file to direct requests to cgimap or to a rails port
# API server, depending on if cgimap can handle the request. It assumes cgimap
# is running on port 8000 and that /var/www is the DocumentRoot
# Requires mod_rewrite, mod_proxy and mod_proxy_http

# Adjust as needed for the DocumentRoot. You will need to create the api
# directory, but nothing need be in it.
